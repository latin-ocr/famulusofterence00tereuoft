425-483 NOTES 67

425. misit. orare. The infinitive of purpose, which is found
⁷ in classical poetry after do, dono, trado, and seems to have been
regular in the phrase bibere da, is frequent in old Latin aster
verbs of motion such as eo and mitto, just as Horace uses it
aster ago τ see l. 2. note.

429. maxumo te orabat opere. The division here shows «

that magno opere should be written as two words.
433. malam rem hinc ibis: the old use of the accusative

without a preposition (cf. exequias ire), but Terence has also the
later in malam rem.

434. ut transeas, sc. orat te.

435. ad militem, to the captain’s : cf. 469, 529, 754, 774.

substantive of ἔρχομαι, so sometimes via of eo.

441. male me habens, ταλαιπώρως ἔχων, ‘in distress of mind)

442. devorticulum is a lane leading down (de) from the high-
road.

447. extrema linea. The proverbial expression is perhaps
taken from the theatre‚ where lineae were barriers. The man in

the pit gazes at a beauty in a private box.
· 456. absente nobis: a natural construction to the sense like
the ‘ you was ’ of the eighteenth century.

458. in’ hine, ‘ won’t you be off‚' i.e. go along with you.

460. famulum quem. The antecedent is attracted to the case
of the relative as in Henry the Fifllc’s ‘ He which hath no
stomach to this sight, 1 Let him depart ⁹.

469. ad nos, παρ’ ἡμᾶς.

iam, ‘ at once,' goes with scies.

470. capta fui: see 488 note. The phrase here is Newman’s.

471. miserae, sc. mihi.

472. nam, ‘for else.’ Scan mz‘m {llum ἅίῖᾳηο with a
paraceleusmatic.

474. male conciliate, ‘you vile bargain! Cicero also uses
the verb in this sense of ⁴ buy ’.

476. huo reditio. In old Latin, as in Greek, verbal nouns
could take a verbal construction, e.g. tactio hunc, iusta orator.

. 477. cessassem, ‘ had lingered.’

478. adornarat fugam, ‘had got ready his flight‚' i.e. was
just about to bolt.

483. nostrarum: genitive feminine of nos. The masculine
form nostrum was usually substituted sor it and is the only form
in later use. Etymologically both forms are not from nos but from
noster, but the original genitive of nos is not found in extant
Latin.

quisquam. This is the only form of the feminine nomina-
