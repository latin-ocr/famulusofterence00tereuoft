PROSODY

THE language of Terence is the contemporary speech of
Rome. His metre, it is true, was borrowed from Greece,
with such changes only as were necessary for its use in
a stressed tongue, but his pronunciation was not altered to
suit his metre. It was not so with the Latin poets from
Ermius downward. They borrowed their measures srom the
unstressed language of Greece, in which quantities were much
more sharply marked than in their own, and they used an
artificial pronunciation to suit their scansions. They were
not wrong. Colloquial pronunciation suits ill with the epic
style. The learner who passes from Virgil 01· Ovid to
Plautus or Terence must learn to speak the Latin words not
as they were recited but as they were actually spoken in the
house and the street. We may take an actual illustration.
Virgil wrote as the beginning os a dactylic hexameter the

words
Italiam fato profugus.

The same words in colloquial pronunciation would make

¹ the beginning of an iambic trimeter. To obtain his effect it

is probable that Virgil gave to the first vowel of Italiam
somewhat more length than it had in common speech, while
he somewhat reduced the stress on the second syllable as on
the first syllable offalo and prcffugus. Thus the stronger
stress of common speech had a considerable effect upon
colloquial quantities. What was zvolezplales in poetry was
volaptates in the comic writers. Thus in ordinary English
