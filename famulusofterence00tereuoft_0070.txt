66 FAM VLVS 374-422

And as for knowledge, give him but the cue well
And he will be omniscient as VVhewell.

376. dabo, ‘ show‚’ hence ‘warrant ¹.

382. sat habet, ‘he is satisfied.’

384. nam, ‘ yes, for—’ Scan miserique* naim hercle.

385. qui pararet, ‘means to buy.’ ln this sense paro tended
to supplant ema : cf. Italian comprare. ·

387. qui induxeris: causal subjunctive, as in 567.

388. e flamma. At Athens a honey-cake was put beside a
corpse as an offering to Cerberus, but here the reference may beto
the Roman custom of burning food with the corpse: cs. Virg. Aen.
vi. 22 5 congesta cremantur Ι turea dona, dapes. The man who
would steal from a pyre would stick at nothing to get a dinner.

389. iamne imus P ‘ do we start at once ? ’ i.e. why don’t we?

390. poste. The original form ofp05t‚ seen inpostea, &c.

393. simin 's. The MSS. give similis es, for which Bentley
read simia ⁹5, Fleckeisen simius ’s. Gnatho must have some
ground for laughing and even Thraso could not think similis to
be a piece of his own wit.

396. abi prae. In old Latin some adverbs, which were
afterwards used only as prepositions, kept their original force.
So in Attic prose πρός, ‘rnoreover,' and in verse also ἐν and ξύν.

397. fiat, ‘be it so.’ Perhaps we should read fiet with ,

Fleckeisen.

398. hoc: see 69 note.

401. quid? ‘ stop.’

405. dabit, θήσει, ‘ will causes

408. roget quis. The subjunctive is hypothetical without si
and the present is graphic for the pluperfect. The sense of the
apodosis is in the words ne noram quidem. He might with dull
accuracy have said siquis me rogasset, respondissem (or respondere
potui) me ne novisse quidem.

410. ait fecisse, sc. se, a common colloquial ellipse.

rem divinam fecisse, ‘had made a sacrifice.' Like ῥέζω

facio is common in this sense, the victim‚ if expressed, being
in the ablative.

414. friget, sc. sermo. Our metaphor is ‘ flagged ’.

416. Sunii. If the word were not Greek but Latin the locative
would be S uni.

417. avellere : colloquial present for future, as in Virg. Aen.
iv. 338 neque ego hanc abscondere furto Ι speravi, ne finge, fugam.

⁴39. perit is more likely graphic present than contracted
pe ect.

422. ut est audacia, ‘such is her impudence’: cf. Ad. 389
ut est dementia.
