6 PROSODY

the first syllable of ‘ irresponsible ’ is short, but by pronouncing
either ν Tennyson was able to make it long in the line

Irresponsible indolent reviewers.

The first syllable of ‘hexameters’ is colloquially short, but
again by uttering it in full form Tennyson makes it long in
his pentameter

Barbarous experiment, barban-ons hexameters.

In fact scansion by pure quantity was perhaps hardly more
native and natural to Latin than it is to English. It is
possible in either language, but hardly in colloquial speech.
Terence’s metre is quantitative, but in his stressed tongue he
had to put himself under restrictions from which the Greek
poets were free. Thus Aristophanes could end a line

πυνθάνομαι πάνυ σφόδρα,
but Terence could not end a line

edidicit pater meus.

We obscure the distinction by speaking Greek, as it was not
spoken, with stress.

It must be remembered that by Terence’s time Latin poly-
syllables‚ with some exceptions‚ bore the stress on the
penultimate if it was long and on the antepenultimate if the
penultimate was short. The exception which is of most
consequence in metrical matters is that of a quadrisyllable
beginning with three short. Here the stress came on the
first syllable. We see this clearly in oui· play in such

endings as
falsa lacrumula

Γ
0 nostri fundi calamitas.

The following rules will help to show the effect of stress
upon quantity.
