134—176 NOTE.Q > 59

134. nil: emphatic sor mm, as old English‘ nothing afraid'.
nil moror seems to have been first used by a judge 1n dis-
missing a case. Thence it passed through the meaning οἱ( ignore'
to that of ‘ dislike'. Cf. Hor. Ep. I. xv. 16‘· aina ni'lzzl moror
i‘llzus orae. Here Phaedria means ‘I object’ .

136. te⁰ dmo‘. The hiatus shows that the pronoun is emphatic,
i.e. in this case affectionate.

137. hoc, ‘the next‚’ as in 205. With a past or present verb
it would mean ‘the last '.

139. maxume, μάλιστα, ‘ by all mean5‚’ ‘certainly.’

141. numquid vis aliud P The usual formula of leave-
taking: ‘anything more Ι can do for you ? '

egone quid velim. ⁹ When a speaker before answering
a question repeats the words of the interrogator he changes the
verb into the subjunctive with an ellipse of qnaerzsne an: cf. 309,
458, 481 So in Greek the indirect interrogatives, ὅπως, ὁπω ’τε,
and the hke are used.

143. me ames. The emphatic pronoun in hiatus, whereas
below te unemphatic is elided.

152. quiequid huius. The genitive is called that os the
indefinite whole, and is classed with such phrases as lzoc morhs
164, istuc ornati 176. Since lmc morbi means the same as
llic morbus the genitive might be classed as one of definition.

154. adeo, ‘ very?

156. dum venit.. With dum the present indicative is a
corrrfimon substitute for the logical present subjunctive or future
pe eet.

157. quod poteris. Itis possible that quod is a shortened
form of quoad as in 366, but more likely the construction is as in
quantum potest.

161. perpeti, ὥστε ὑπομεῖναι, consecutive infinitive.

163. opus, ‘ farm work ’: so opera, ‘farm labourer.’

usque= usque eo.
164. di boni: an exclamation, not a prayer: cf. 171.
Scan quid hove morbi.
169. honesta, ‘beautiful ’ : cf. 283, 372. So always in Virgil.
me turpiter dabo, ‘ I shall make a wretched show.' The
phrase is colloquial. For do see on 229.

1'72. hoe adeo, ‘just this.‘ This usage of adeo is found with
pronouns‚ numerals, and adverbs : cf. 186.

173. loci, ‘rank‚’ as in 180. ·

hine, sc. Athenis, i.e. an Athenian.

176. ornati. The. common speech and some men of letters

eschewed, as far as possible, the fourth declension.
