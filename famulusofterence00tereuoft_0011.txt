PROSODY 7

Bmwns Buvmms.

(i) Some iambic words ending in a vowel shorten llze second
vowel. In some instanees this usage was so completely
established tha't even the poets did not venture to go back to
the original quantity. This was the case with bene and male,
nistu and quasi, and several words in o, e. g. cito, ego‘. In
Terence some imperatives are thus shortened‚ as cave 547,
roga 497·

(ii) Iambz'c words ending in a vowel shorten the vowel before
a stressed syllable. We have perhaps an instance of this in tace
tu 386, but this may come under the former rule. So domi 478.

(iii) Iambic words ending in a consonant shorten the vowel
cs it be long, and do nol make long position bq‘ore other con-
sonants, ts llze next syllable be stressed and sometimes gf it be
not. Examples are fores hae' 2 10, soror (licta 107, negat quis
¹91 ‚ simal consilium 180.

(iv) In words ot· combinations of words of three or more
syllables a long vowel or position z’s shortened when z't follows

⁵ a short and precedes or follows a stressed syllable. Examples

are ego exclador 109, in hoc biduom 140, sed eccam ipsa 34,
quo‘d intellexi 533, quid interest 172, o indignum 25, neque
n‘nde eam 233.

Loss OF FmAL CONSONANT.

(i) F inal s before a consonant was essen not pronounced.
The literary men endeavoured to restore the letter, but in the
end the common speech was too strong for them: compare
somnus and Italiansonno. Examples are viden for videsne,
potin for petisne, vetii' veternosus 493, opi? faciam 163. It
is usual to write the letter, but instead of magis it is possible
that we should write the form mage.

(ii) F inal m was dropt in some common words, especially
quidem. Examples are ellim curate 402, enim vero 255.
