70 FAMVLVS 601-656

quin redeamus ε lit. ‘ why should we not return ?’ but the
interrogative sense is lost and the phrase comes to mean ‘ well,
we had better return '. Hence quin ceased to be used in
questions except when the question was nominal and no answer
was expected. In Ciceronian Latin a real question had curnon.
603. nolunt, ubi velis. In general present suppositions the
subjunctive is used regularly in the indefinite second person
singular, rarely with other persons.
605. domi is the only form of the gen. in the comic poets.
domi focique memineris. An amusing parody of the
words in which a general would encourage his men to fight.

He sees his brood about thy knee
And strikes a blow for thern and thee.

607. pergin’. The word is specially used of going on in
speaking.

610. nuspiam, i.e. not to be found.

615. atqui, ‘certainly.’

619. abest virgo. The text, however, is N ewrnan‘s.

620. istucine interminata sum, i.e. have you acted accord-
ing to my instructions, which were given with threats. Thais in
her anger does not well remember what she had said.

627. facias. The strict equivalent of faciemus of the oratio
recta would be facturi silis or fizcluri simus, but this is a clumsy
periphrasis, and rnoreover, since faciemus is used in the sense of
faciamus, would hardly be logical.

629. tum: see 231 note.

confidentia, ‘ assurance.’ Cf. Virg. Georg. iv. 445 nam
quis te, iuvenum confidentissime, nostras ι iussit adire domos ,9

631. dedita opera, ‘ os set purpose‚’ data opera, ‘ attentively.'

635. me, sc. dedi.

638. fui =faclus sum.

640. mea, sc. refert.

641. vir is ironical, since it would not properly be addressed
to a slave but to a gentleman. So to the messenger who with a
too hasty entry cries ‘ Where is my lady? ’ Portia replies ‘ Here :
what would my lord ?’‚ M. (ff V. 11. ix.

642. satin’, ‘ quite? Thais asks him whether he can justify
his elopement.

644. occidito: see 61 note.

656. fuerat. This aoristic use of the pluperfect shows perhaps
the original meaning of the tense. It is used tolay emphasis on
the past nature of the action as a thing irrevocable : cf. Juvenal
vi. 281 olim convenerat, ‘ we settled this long ago‚' and cannot
now reopen the question ε cf. below 775.
