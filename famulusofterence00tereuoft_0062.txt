58 FAMVLVS 81—133

81. amabo, ‘ please.'

82. Scan ems.

84. fidibus scire. There is no conscious ellipse, though the
original phrase may have had canere or uli. The ablative is
used as the adverb in Graece scire, ἃς.

91. apud me. Here the pronoun is enclitic and dm make
long position for u. In 185 the preposition is proclitic and scans
(175171l saeclum.

Scan m* mai.

100. id adiuta me, ‘help me in this.' The accusative is used
in the same way with intransitive verbs, and is usually either,
as here, a neuter pronoun or a general word like omnia: cf.
Cic. de Or. Ι. ix. 35 celera adsentior Crasso, and below 192, 249,
314, ·6·

1037.³ cum istis factis, ‘since your doings are what they are.’
It seems less likely that the prepositional phrase goes adjectivally
with libs.

¹04· perdoluit, ‘ he has felt it.’ 1f however the subject
be Thais, the meaning must be that she must have shrunk at his
words.

105. nescibam. Such forms, older than nesciebam, &c., died
out in written prose, but survived in poetical and country use:
cs. scibis 595.

110. nisi si. The pleonasm is also Ciceronian.

si illum. The pronoun being emphatic sz' suffers elision.
For the same reason scan me‘ ὅπως, while the following pronouns
being unemphatic we must scan {stam and 7ῑέ illum.

112. cedo is formed of the pronoun ccu (English ‘he ⁹), seen in
llum, mmc, &c., and do the original imperative of dare. The
verb do does not belong to the first conjugation, but was
assimilated to it in some forms, e. g. das, da. Here cedo means
“’ tell rne ⁹, in 566 ‘bring up ’, sometimes ‘hand me here ’.

114. claudier. Such old infinitive forms survived in later
poetry, eg. Virgil's dominarier, Horace’s spmgier.

115. Aethiopia. The stress as in lacrumula 22.

118. reginae, ‘ great ladies.’ A like sense of rex is very
common.

l 120. tamen, like ὅμως, sometimes appears in the concessive
c ause.

121. quid istic ἑ) In this formula of assent, ‘oh, very well,'
istic is the adverb and there is an ellipse, but hardly a conscious
one, os dicis or some like word.

133. ne fiant, sc. vereor.

isti, i.e. the two days7 the word for which is always biduom.
