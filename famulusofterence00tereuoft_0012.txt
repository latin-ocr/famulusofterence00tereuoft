ILLE ΑΜ) ΙετΕ.

These pronouns have each two different pronunciations
according as they are emphatic or not. We may compare
our own pronunciation of he, him, her, and the like, which,
if they are emphatic or begin a sentence, keep their aspirate,
but in other cases drop it and become proclitics or enclitics.
Thus we say ‘I told him but not his brother ’, where him
keeps and his loses the aspirate. So in classic English we do
not say ‘I told him ¹ but ‘ I told ’im '.

The nominatives ille and illa if emphatic were trochees‚ as
ego excludor, ill? recipitur 109, but otherwise the final vowel
was lost and the word became ill', and hence Italian il. So
z'll’ sese 269.

In the cases if emphatic the first syllable was long as
nz'sz'sz' illum plus amas quam me 110. Otherwise the word
became an enclitic or a proclitic with the former syllable
short. Thus in 101 sine illum was pronounced sinz‘lum.
A good contrast is supplied by the emphatic hac alque illac
of 60 and the unemphatic mater mea {llic mortua ’sl, where
z'llz'c is a proclitic‚ as the English word would be an enclitic,
‘ my mother died there.'

The same rule applies to the cases os isle. We have the
two uses in 284 and 285, the emphatic istunc szsum and the
unemphatic sed islam. Thus the phrase quid Jslz'c was stressed
as our word ‘fiddlestick '.
