42—81 NOTES v 57

42. quor: later cur, from qua re.
ceterum, δ’ οὖν, ‘that's all very well, but!
45. missa face, ‘ drop '=mz'tte.
face. In Terence's time sace, dice, and duce could still be
used. The loss of the final vowel was caused or helped by the
existence of such athematic forms as fer, em, do'.

47. fieret is impersonal and the following clause definitive.

fieret. The original long vowel. It is sometimes said that
the quantity is always retained when the word ends the line, but
this will not do fora reason, since words were not pronounced so
as to scan, but scanned as they were pronounced.

50. ne crucia. The imperative in direct prohibitions died
out later except in poetry.

53. prae amore. The prepositional phrase is spoken as one
word; cf. 119, &c.

exclusti. Such forms are probably not contractions but
older forms of the sigmatic aorist afterwards supplanted by the
longer forms ; cf. dixti, amisti.

55. iussi. In old Latin a dependent question is often in the
indicative; cf. 687.

56. potin’. The form potis is used for all genders. Here it
is masculine.

57. lege, ‘condition‚⁷ the original meaning: cf. Virg. Georg.
iv. 487 namque lmnc dederat Proserpina legem.

61. taceri: impersonal.

dicito. The suffix, the ablative of the stem seen in lum and
lam meant originally ‘thereupon ’, and hence the form is used in
emphatic commands of the future. There is a good example in

62. Samia. Probably the final vowel is long as in Greek.

69. hoe=huc. Both forms are accusative and were at first
used indifferently‚ then specialized : cf. 314, 398. Virgil, who
liked an occasional archaism, uses laec for hither in Aen. viii. 423
hoc tunc Igvziflotens caelo descendit ab allo.

70. unde, ‘from whom,' is a true ablative pronoun, as often in
Cicero ε so ubi 240.

74. Scan ξξό cnm {llo with a proceleusmatic. To elide cnm
would give a false emphasis to illo.

76, 77. interea and interea loci, ⁸ after a time.' The caseis
perhaps locative. The meaning of ‘ time ² was kept by locus in
the phrase in loco, ἐν καιρῷ. In Virgil interea often means not
‘ meanwhile ' but ‘ after a time ’.

81. hoe agite, ‘ attend.’ The negative is aliud agere or as in
274 alias res agere.
