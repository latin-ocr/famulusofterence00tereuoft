56 FAMVLVS ψῃ

23. misere vix vi seems to be a colloquial chax‚ in which
case misere has the sense of ‘not easily '‚ but it may be taken
with terendo.

2 5. ei and ὅ indignum ι see Prosody.

27. taedet, sc. me amoris.

28. agam. The subjunctive in the dependent question re-
presents a subjunctive in the direct : cf. 653, See.

29. nisi, i. e. m'l est quod agas nisi.

captum. The slave speaks of his master as a prisoner of
war·

30. at, ἀλλά, ‘at any rate.'

quanti queas, ὅσου ἂν δυνηθῇς, but in Latin the subjunctive
is due to the dependence on another subjunctive, as queas in 29.

31. ne te adflictos. Probably not a command but dependent
upon ut above. Originally ne was a simple negative. An
affirmative sentence, faciam cogites (cf. 139), would have for its
negative faciam ne cogites. Then in both forms ut was inserted.
Later when non supplanted ne as the usual negative, ut was
dropped in the negative form, but ut ne is found as late as
Cicero’s time, and colloquially, it is probable‚ lasted to a much
later time. The final nt ne is in 698.

34. eccam probably = ecce leam, the form of hanc without the
pronominal suffix -ce‚ but some take it for ecce eam.

calamitas seems originally to have meant ‘hail ’‚ and
thence anything destructive to crops.

36. illud, ἐκεῖνο, anticipates the quod clause. In English we
say not ‘that ’ but ‘ this '. Scan ne* illud.

37. atque perhaps goes with gravius as well as with aliorsum.
The use of it for quam is colloquial, but also occurs in poetry
and in late prose.

38. totus tremo, ‘ I quiver all over.’ The use of this
adjective is found also in written prose, but the corresponding
negative, e. g. nullus moneas, 159, is colloquial.

4ο. iam calesces. With a future z‘am, ‘at once,' is stronger
than mox, ‘after a time’ : cf. 162.

plus satis. With stafilius, longz'u5‚pl1cs, and minus this
form, which means ‘ enough and more ', is more usual than plus
quam salis, διε.

41. Scan quz‘s ln'c lo'quftzir csse‘m tun’. The line opens with
a proceleusmatic followed by a tribrach.

tun’ hie eras Ρ παρῆσθα ἄρα mh When what has for some
time been true is sor the first time recognized the imperfect is

idiomatic, but in Latin the use is almost confined to the verb
sum.
