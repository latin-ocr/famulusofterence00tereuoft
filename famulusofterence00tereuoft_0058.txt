NOTES

1. igitur, perhaps rather ‘ in the circumstances’ than exactly
‘therefore '. The former meaning was the 'older‚ but in that
sense the word usually comes first in the sentence.

faciam: eam. These subjunctives are not well named
deliberative, for (i) the deliberation is not in the mood but in the
interrogative, (ii) they can be as well addressed to another as to
oneself‚ and (iii) the indicative can as readily be used as the
subjunctive, the difference being no more than that between
‘ what am I to do next '? and ‘ what do I do next ’ἓ Mr. Duff
on Juvenal iii. 296 tries to distinguish between the subjunctive as
expecting and the indicative as not expecting an answer, but
this will not hold, at any rate for the Comedians and Virgil.
Thus below in l. 601 qnid nunc agimus? and Ι. 604 iam dimitto
arem-stunt? answers are certainly expected and actually given.
So And. 315 adeone ad eum? Adel. 538 quid agimus? Virg. γ
Aen. iii. 88 quem sequimur? The indicative is somewhat more
colloquial than the subjunctive.

2. quom : later cum.

ultro. It had been his custorn to go without invitation.

ita anticipates the infinitive which, as keeping some of its

me comparem, ‘ make up my mind.’

3. Scan pnffllarum.

5. prius, sc. est. The mood is indicative because the state-
ment is true apart from the truth or falsehood of the protasis:
cf. melius est, satius est, ‘ it would be better.'

6. incipies, rather ‘ take in hand’ than ‘begin’ : cf. 718, 780.

neque is for el non, colloquial irregularity, and frequent in
Liv .

ynav-lter. Adverbs of this form, which probably show the
suffix -lero, used in Gk. for comparantes, were in the case of 0-
sterns largely supplanted by the forms in -ε, originally ablatives
in -ed : thus earlier duriter, later dure.

7. nemo, i.e. no messenger from Thais.

9. aetum est is a forcible colloquialism for actum erit, as
