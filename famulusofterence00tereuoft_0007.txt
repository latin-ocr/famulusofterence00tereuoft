PREFACE

Tm: comedy of Terence, from which Famulus is adapted
and condensed, was regularly acted at Westminster through-
out the eighteenth century and down to the year 1854. It
was then dropped, as in its original form it was not in all
ways suited for presentation on the stage. It is, however,
one of Terence’s most lively plays, and last year Dr. Gow
determined to restore it with omissions and alterations.

A version under the name of pincerna had been prepared for '

school use by Cardinal Newman. Dr. Gow's version is
based upon this but is further condensed. Most of Cardinal
Newman’s lines have disappeared‚ and of the few that remain
it has been necessary in the larger number to make altera-
tions. When Newman made his text the niceties of Teren-
tian metre were not well understood, and his lines have
metrical flaws. The original text has also been carefully
revised. The stage directions follow the performance of last
year.

It is hoped that so good a comedy as this may be welcomed
in schools and that for form use a play somewhat shortened
may be convenient.

We have to thank Dr. Gow for allowing us to annotate his

version.
