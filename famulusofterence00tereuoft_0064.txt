(30 FAMVLVS 176—204

176. perdidi, ‘have run through,' not ‘ have lost ’.

177. atque, ‘ and what's more.'

179. itan’ parasti te t> ‘have you brought yourself to this ?’

relicua: always four syllables in the comedians.

181. quae habitudo: see on 143.

habitudo, ‘ plumpness ’ : so habilior, ‘ rather plump.’

182. nil quom ’st. In the comedians both causat quom and
concessive quom are common with the indicative : cf. 395.

183. ridiculus, ‘ a jester,’ as a parasite was expected to be.

184. fieri, sc. ltoc.

tota via is like our slang expression ‘ all along the line ⁹.

185. fuit: monosyllabic‚ or the last letter is dropt.

apud saeclum. Though this would scan as it stands, it is
probable that the pronunciation would be better expressed by
apusaeclum.

saeclum. ln such forms with the suffix -tla later prose
usage inserted the parasitic ιι which the comedians sometimes
write for convenience of scansion.

186. novom, καινόν, ‘ noveL' ‘new—fashioned.’

187. esse se volunt, ‘set up for being': esse volunt, ‘are
read to be!

1833. hisee. This nominative is a double plural formed by
adding the plural termination s to the plural hi: cf. English ‘kine'.
lt occurs again below, and in the form lzis is put by Virgil into
a shepherd’s mouth. Usually lzz'sce precedes vowels, lzz's con-
sonants.

190. negant. The verb nego (nec-faio), though assimilated
to the first conjugati0n‚ remained the negative of aio. In old
Latin nec often means ‘not ’.

191. imperavi mihi adsentari. The infinitive stands as an
accusative object to imperavi where later prose usage preferred
an ut clause.

195. opperiri. The MSS. give Thaidis with a false scansion.
Clearly Thaidis was a marginal note meant to define ostium, and
by creeping into the text displaced the genuine reading which
was conjecturally restored by Bentley.

196. frigent, i. e. find no favour. So in Tlte Alerchant os
l 'em'ce the scroll tells the Prince of Morocco ‘Your suit is cold ².

199. summum auom. Sometimes anticum is expressed‚ as
in Phor. 3 5 amicus summus meus.

201. qui dum Ρ πῶς δι’] ; The emphatic enclitic, as in primum
dum, is the accusative of a pronominal stem used adverbially.

2341 omnium . The sentiment is general, almost pro-
ver ia.
