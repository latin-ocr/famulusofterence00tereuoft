206-229 NOTES ’ 61

206. deorsum: probably disyllabic.

207. soleo, sc. beare, the ellipse being usual.

208. profectus fueras ε see on 488.

209. nusquam is colloquial in this sense. Compare the
double usage of iulus and our ‘ where '.

operae, ‘ help,’ ‘ service.’ operam dare has also the sense
of ‘take pains ⁹.

210. istam: emphatic and scornful.

211. numquem . . . . The implication is that Parmeno is
refused admittance.

212. digitulo. To obtain admittance it was usual either to
rap or to kick at the door. Thus Horace makes death kick at
our doors. Here it is implied that now Gnatho can obtain
admittance by the gentlest tap of a little finger, but the time
will come when his loudest kick will receive no attention.

213. ne, etymologically rather νὴ than ναί, always precedes
a pronoun.

faxo is probably like τάξω, an aorist subjunctive, but, also
like τάξω, is used as a future.

faxo insultabis. This paratax, a survival of earlier usage,
is more common in the comedians than the syntactical faciam
ut insultes: cf. 469.

216. placeant : the generic use of the consecutive sub-
junctive.

218. qui, ‘how.’

eustos, περίπολος. There was a guard to the harbour and
arsenal.
publice, δημοσίᾳ, ‘on public service!

219. non temere, οὐκ ἐτός, ‘not without purpose.' The word

is an old ablative meaning originally ⁴ in the dark ³.

nescioquid is spoken as one word, trisyllabic with the
stress on the penultimate. Bentley's nescio gives a false dactyl :
see on 22.

221. neque . . ·⁷ ‘the girl is lost and so am I.’ He plays on
two meanings of nusquam.

222. insistam is used in its original sense.

223. ubi ubi is the locative of quisquis and must have been
pronounced ububz'.

' diu ε monosyllabic3 so dehinc, as regularly.

226. ὅ infortunatum: cf. ὅ ἴηιίίὲητιυι 2 5.

227. hie . . . . There is acolloquial anacoluthon. The formal
sentence would run, ‘ This fellow is one, who, if he stans, will
so go on that his brother will be child's play to him.’

229. dabit, ‘will do.’ In this sense do represents not δίδωμι
