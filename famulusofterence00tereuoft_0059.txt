106 tu regibus alas Ι eripe& Hor. Car. Ι. ix. 15 nec dulcis
amores 1 sperne, puer, neque tu choreas.

to the antecedent and to the relative clause, and may be ex-
pressed with either or with both. Here expressed with the
relative only.

falsa. lacrumula.1n very early Latin the word· stress in
a quadrisyllable came on the first 5) llable, and this usage seems
to have surviv ed in words of the type υ υ υ Ξ. Hence there
is here no violation of the rule that in a dactylic foot a word-
stress must, except in the first foot of a line, come on the
second syllable. cf.34,100‚ 120 ἃς.
lact-urnula. The di1ni'3'nutixe 15 contempnmus as in 212
